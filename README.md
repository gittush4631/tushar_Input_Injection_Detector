The frequent and basic approach for detecting the web application security threats by using web application scanner tools. These tools are based on methodology of static or dynamic. Still to this date both this approaches are used independently for web application vulnerability scanning and having its limitations and advantages. For protecting the web applications from different attacks, vulnerabilities should remove early. The innovative method called Cluster Based Java Input Injection Detection (CJIID) that can help to detect the vulnerabilities before its deployment has been proposed.This approach can reduce not only the cost of fixing the vulnerabilities but also saves time. The paper presentsthe new framework for detection of different types of web application vulnerabilities efficiently. The proposed method uses both static and dynamic analysis techniques in order to detect vulnerabilities present in web applications. CJIID approach helps in reduction of false positives and false negatives, cost, as well as the time required for fixing the vulnerabilities. The focus is on input injection vulnerabilities as they are most common vulnerabilities found in todayâ€™s web applications. Injection vulnerabilities are those vulnerabilities that are exploited by entering a malicious input value. The efficiency of this method is further improved by adding the clustering approach of web crawled input URLs. This is a automated technique.
